## Change Log

* **v1.3.0** (2019-04-19)
    * **Compatible with Pilosa 1.2 and 1.3**
    * Added `manualServerAddress` client option which forces the client use only the manual server address.
    * Removed experimental `PilosaClient.withAddress` variant that sets the coordinator address manually. Use `manualServerAddress` client option instead.

    * Added `field.rows` and `index.groupBy` calls.
    * Added `PqlBatchQuery.size` and `PqlBatchQuery.clear` methods.
    * Deprecated `field.range` (time) call. Use `field.row` instead.
    * *Experimental*: `PilosaClient.withAddress` supports setting the coordinator address manually.
    * *Experimental*: Added `Schema.index` and `Index.field`  methods support passing index/field options in a map.

* **v1.2.0** (2018-12-19)
    * **Compatible with Pilosa 1.2**
    * Supports imports involving keys.
    * Added support for mutex and bool fields.
    * Added `index.Options`, `field.ClearRow` and `field.Store` functions to support the corresponding PQL calls.
    * Added `com.pilosa.client.csv` package.
    * Added support for roaring importing `RowIDColumnID` with timestamp data.
    * Updated `com.pilosa.roaring` dependency for improved memory usage.
    * Improved import speed.
    * Fixed schema synchronization.
    * Enabled creating the *uber jar* which contains the Pilosa client and all its dependencies in a single jar.
        * Run `mvn -f com.pilosa.client/pom.xml -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean package`
        * `*pilosa-client-*-uber.jar` is created in `com.pilosa.client/target` directory.
    * Deprecated: `indexOptions.keys`, use `indexOptions.setKeys` instead.
    * Deprecated: `indexOptions.trackExistence`, use `indexOptions.setTrackExistence` instead.
    * Deprecated: `fieldOptions.keys`, use `fieldOptions.setKeys` instead.

* **v1.0.2** (2018-10-12)
    * Added `trackExistence` index option.
    * Added `not` index method to support `Not` queries. The corresponding index must be created with `trackExistence=true` option. This feature requires Pilosa on master branch.
    * Added support for roaring imports which can speed up the import process by %30 for non-key column imports. Pass `setRoaring(true)`` to `ImportOptions.builder()` to enable it. This feature requires Pilosa on master branch.
    * Fixes: `Column.create` method. See: https://github.com/pilosa/java-pilosa/pull/127

    * Added `Xor` call.
    * Added range field operations.
    * Added support for excluding bits or attributes from bitmap calls. In order to exclude bits, call `setExcludeBits(true)` in your `QueryOptions.Builder`. In order to exclude attributes, call `setExcludeAttributes(true)`.
    * Customizable CSV time stamp format.
    * `HTTPS connections are supported.
    * **Deprecation** Row and column labels are deprecated, and will be removed in a future release of this library. Do not use `IndexOptions.Builder.setColumnLabel` and `FrameOptions.Builder.setRowLabel` methods for new code. See: https://github.com/pilosa/pilosa/issues/752 for more info.
